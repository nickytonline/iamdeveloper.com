</a><h2>Words of Wisdom for the Week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a reminder that we&rsquo;re built-as human beings-to respond well to positive interactions.</p>
<p>According to &ldquo;Make us React: The neuroscience of Narrative&rdquo;, &ldquo;If you treat me well, in most cases my brain will synthesize oxytocin and this will motivate me to treat you well in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treating people well is the right thing to do, but there&rsquo;s also incentive. You&rsquo;re more likely to grow in an environment you feel supported in, to innovate, and to be productive in that environment.</p>
