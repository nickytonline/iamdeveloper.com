<p>So I&rsquo;m back on <a href="http://buttondown.email?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-issue-72-you-dont-unit" target="_blank">buttondown.email</a>. It was great when I was using it before the brief move to Substack and then the move to Revue. The only reason I moved to Revue was because it was tightly integrated to Twitter in what appeared to be a good thing. Twitter followers could discover my newsletter a lot easier. Fast forward to 2022 and it looks like they&rsquo;re phasing out Revue at Twitter.</p>
