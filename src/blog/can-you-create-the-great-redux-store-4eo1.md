There's a great free video course on Redux from Dan Abramov on egghead.io, [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux). I highly recommend watching it.

In one of the videos in the series, [Redux: Implementing Store from Scratch](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-implementing-store-from-scratch), he explains how to create the great Redux store. It's essentially what the store is, minus some edge cases etc.

Do you think you can create it from scratch without looking at the video?

This challenge isn't a who got it first kind of challenge. It's really just for you. Really try to do it without looking at the video. Once you're done, watch the video and see how close you came to the solution.
