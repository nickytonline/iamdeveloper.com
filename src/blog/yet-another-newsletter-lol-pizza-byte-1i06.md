<p>Before we get started, I was wondering about the cadence of this newsletter. Do you all enjoy receiving it weekly, or would every two weeks or once a month be better for you all? Please let me know by dropping an email to nick at nickyt.co.</p>
<p>And with that, another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>This is plugging my work (shameless plug I guess), but even before I joined, I loved the high quality videos that <a href="https://opensauced.pizza/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-pizza-byte" target="_blank">OpenSauced</a> put out, and this one, although they do have a serious discussion, the setting and the tone are hilarious. Also, all I wanted to do after watching this video was to eat pizza lol.</p>
