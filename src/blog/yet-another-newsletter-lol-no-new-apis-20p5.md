<p>Another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">Next.js 14</a> was announced this past week at Next.js Conf. It seemed a little underwhelming, but there have been stability and performance improvements. Server Actions are no longer experimental, and pre-rendered partial rendering (PPR) is in preview. There is also an <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">updated tutorial</a> if you‚Äôre interested in learning Next.js. </li>
<li>Speaking of Next.js, Sebastien Castel (@scastiel) has a great post on server actions, <a href="https://scastiel.dev/simplest-example-server-actions-nextjs?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">The simplest example to understand Server Actions in Next.js</a>.</li>
<li>My former employer, Netlify, has been dropping all kinds of primitives for the platform, including this one, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cache-key-variations/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">Netlify Cache Key Variations</a>. So now request caching can vary on several things including header, language, country, and cookie.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>This is so freaking cool. <a href="https://x.com/steeevg/status/1717962981412409811?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">Steve Garner</a> made a game with <a href="https://threejs.org?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">three.js</a>, <a href="https://gsap.com?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">Greensock</a> and <a href="https://stately.ai?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">Stately.ai</a>.</p>

<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>This week was a triple threat for me in terms of streaming. On Monday, Scott Steinlage joined me on <a href="https://nickyt.live?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" target="_blank">nickyt.live</a> to chat about growth, marketing, DevRel, community, all the things!</p>
<p>Here's a highlight from the stream.</p>{% embed "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1959671926?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" %}
<p>The full recording will be dropping on <a href="nickyt.tube" target="_blank">https://nickyt.tube</a> this coming week.</p>
<p>Wednesday, my co-worker @bekahhw joined me for a final Hacktoberfest check-in. We also gave a bunch of shout-outs to all the OpenSauced contributors from the past week.</p>{% embed "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1960026264?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-no-new-apis" %}
<p>Friday was my monthly stream on the cfe.dev YouTube channel. I was back with another 2 Full 2 Stack episode exploring the latest stuff in Next.js the day after they released Next.js 14 at Next.js Conf.</p>
