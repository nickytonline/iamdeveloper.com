<p>This will be the last newsletter until the new year. I'll be taking some time off to recharge. The next newsletter will be landing January 14th. With that, another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's been another wild year in JavaScript frameworks land. Ryan Carniato gives us a great summary and what to expect in 2024. Check out <a href="https://dev.to/this-is-learning/javascript-frameworks-heading-into-2024-i3l?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">JavaScript Frameworks - Heading into 2024</a>.</li>
<li>If you're still new to <a href="https://servercomponents.dev/what-are-react-server-components?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">React Server Components</a> (RSCs), this is a great explainer from <a href="https://bholmes.dev/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">Ben Holmes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaebEqhZR84&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">React server components from scratch!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">React Aria Components 1.0</a> dropped this week. This is a huge win for the React ecosystem. Amazing work <a href="https://x.com/devongovett/status/1737516074663362843?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">Devon Govett</a> and team!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Over 40 components with built-in behavior, adaptive interactions, top-tier accessibility, and internationalization out of the box, ready for your styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9288030/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">Reacher</a> season one, and I have to say, season two is living up to the hype. If you're looking for action and drama, with a splash of comedy, look no further.</p>
<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>Monday I got to hang with <a href="https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">Saron Yitbarek</a> (@saronyitbarek). She's the founder of <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">CodeNewbie</a> where a bunch of you might know her from, but her latest venture is <a href="https://notadesigner.io/subscribe?ref=oiDwhLbAda&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-time-to-recharge" target="_blank">Not a Designer</a>! we dug into her journey into tech all the way to Not A Designer.</p>

What a great conversation. Thanks for hanging Saron!
