<p>Another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/spa-mode?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-5082" target="_blank">Remix SPA mode</a> looks pretty compelling. <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-5082" target="_blank">React Router</a> being the backbone of Remix makes this a potentially "easy" move to Remix for folks who have been creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-5082" target="_blank">Single Page Applications</a> (SPAs) with just React Router.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/argyleink/status/1748202672816017700?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-5082" target="_blank">Adam Argyle</a>, I learned this week that the CSS <a href="https://www.neatcss.dev/the-anywhere-combinator/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-5082" target="_blank">:has() Can select &lt;meta /&gt; tags</a>. This could potentially help you as a dev when styling things based on certain criteria in them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't aware of the <code>use()</code> hook in React. You can pass it a Promise, and it will suspend on the client. Thanks, <a href="https://x.com/rickhanlonii/status/1747333721164754944?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-5082" target="_blank">Rick Hanoli for the share</a>!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This Wednesday and Thursday, I'll be watching <a href="http://TheJam.dev?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-5082" target="_blank">TheJam.dev</a> conference.

</ul>

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>This is a clip from my most recent stream, and it made me crack up. Maybe it'll bring a smile to your face, too.</p>

<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>Monday, I got to hang with my old co-worker, Salma Alam-Naylor (@whitep4nth3r). She's over at [Sentry](https://sentry.io) now, so we had some fun digging into all that Sentry can do. Here's a highlight. Thanks for hanging, Salma!</p>
