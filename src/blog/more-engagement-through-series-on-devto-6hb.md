I’ve tweeted about this before, but one way I’ve been able to get engagement on old posts is to leverage dev.to’s series feature.

A perfect example of this is my [VS Code Tips](https://dev.to/nickytonline/series/17419) series.

This week’s post came out

and as expected, folks were liking previous posts from the series.

If you haven’t already, try out the series feature!
