<p>Hello 2024! This week was my first week back from PTO. Things were busy (good busy) at work, so it was a great way to start the week all energized.</p>
<p>With that, another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you're looking for beautiful gradients, look no further than <a href="https://www.braydoncoyer.dev/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-hello-2024" target="_blank">Braydon Coyer</a>'s <a href="https://www.pomegradient.com/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-hello-2024" target="_blank">Pomegradient</a>.</li>
<li>Here's a great post from Adam Argyle, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/5-css-snippets-every-front-end-developer-should-know-in-2024?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-hello-2024" target="_blank">5 CSS snippets every front-end developer should know in 2024</a>. Lots of gems in this post.</li>
<li>I use Firefox to test stuff I'm building but aside from that I stopped using it a while ago. I was a big fan of it back in the day, but I think this article sums up the state of Firefox really well, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/the-fall-of-firefox-mozillas-once-popular-web-browser-slides-into-irrelevance/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-hello-2024" target="_blank">The fall of Firefox: Mozilla's once-popular web browser slides into irrelevance</a>.</li>
<li>Lee Robinson dropped a Next.js video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBM03RihZVs&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-hello-2024" target="_blank">10 common mistakes with the Next.js App Router</a>. It‚Äôs definitely worth a watch if you're using Next.js' app router.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>

<p>I had so much fun building a Collaborative piano. Check it out at <a href="https://collabiano.com?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-hello-2024" target="_blank">collabiano.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>

<p>This week, I hung out with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhedges/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-hello-2024" target="_blank">Andrew Hedges</a> from <a href="https://assistivlabs.com/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-hello-2024" target="_blank">Assitiv Labs</a>. I know Andrew from the Collab Lab where he's done a lot of great work. It was great catching up, discussing accessibility, and what Assitiv Labs has to offer in that space.</p>
