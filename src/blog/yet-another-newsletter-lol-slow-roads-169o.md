<p>Another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul><li><p>This repository came on my radar after my co-worker John (@jpmcb) starred it on GitHub. I haven't dug into all of it yet, but it looks like there area plenty of great resources in <a href="https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">github.com/charlax/professional-programming</a></p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p><a href="https://dev.to/this-is-learning/what-is-reactivity-3epf?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">What is Reactivity?</a></p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-4-rc/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TypeScript 5.4 release candidate</a> dropped this week with lots of great additions including <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-4-rc/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads#preserved-narrowing-in-closures-following-last-assignments" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">preserved narrowing in closures following last assignments</a> and the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-4-rc/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads#the-noinfer-utility-type" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NoInfer utility Type</a></p></li><li><p>People make jokes about centering divs all the time, and it can be annoying because CSS is so good these days and makes it really dang easy to do. I came across Josh W. Comeau's article <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/center-a-div/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">How to Center a Div</a> and really appreciated the technical break down of all the techniques to do it. Definitely worth a read!</p></li></ul>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<ul><li><p>This is a very cool demo/game? Check out <a href="https://slowroads.io/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Slow Roads</a>.</p></li></ul>
<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>This week it finally happened. I gave my first in person conference talk, in fact I <a href="https://confoo.ca/en/speaker/nick-taylor?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gave two talks at Confoo</a>! Both talks went really well and I got lots of great feedback.</p>
<p>I also gave a remote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7160791824209498113/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">talk for Global Summit for Node.js `24</a>!</p>

<p>There was no stream this week as I was at the Confoo conference, but I was a guest on the 4 Web Devs, 1 App Idea series from <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Jason Lengstorf</a> (@jlengstorf). This was so much fun! Thanks again for having me on Jason!</p>

<p>The last thing I'll mention is, I think this newsletter is OK, but I've been having a hard think about it. I wrote my thoughts in

This newsletter is going to stick around, but I've decided to create another one that is super laser focused. One valuable tip every week. Obviously, no pressure to sign up, but if that's something that might interest you, head on over to <a href="https://OneTipAWeek.com?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=slow-roads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OneTipAWeek.com</a></p>
<p>That's a wrap! Until the next one.</p>
