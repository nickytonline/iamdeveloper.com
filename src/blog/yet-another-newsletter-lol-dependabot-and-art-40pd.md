<p>I had a very productive week. Three great workouts, a swimming lesson, and lots of great progress at work. How 'bout you?</p>
<p>With that, another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>Who doesn't love a good font that they can add to their editor, so folks can ask, "What font is that?"? ü§£ The <a href="https://monaspace.githubnext.com/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-dependabot-and-art" target="_blank">GitHub Next team just dropped a bunch of fonts</a>, so get them while they're hot.</li>
<li>Not a tonne of things were announced at Next.js Conf, but experimental Partial PreRendering (PPR) was one of them. Here's a great <a href="https://x.com/leeerob/status/1723039087391543654?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-dependabot-and-art" target="_blank">video from Lee Robinson (@leerob) demoing PPR</a>.</li>
<li>Are you a fan of Astro? Are you a fan of Qwik? Well guess what folks? The mashup you thought would never happen, happened! Check out <a href="https://www.builder.io/blog/astro-qwik?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-dependabot-and-art" target="_blank">Astro + Qwik: Houston, we have Resumability!</a></li>
<li>If generics in TypeScript confuse you, or you still find yourself not fully understanding them, you might find this talk from Matt Pocock (@mattpocockuk) helpful, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le5ciL1T7Hk&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-dependabot-and-art" target="_blank">There Is No Such Thing as a 'Generic'</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>I was working on <a href="https://github.com/open-sauced/app/pull/2101?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-dependabot-and-art" target="_blank">this pull request for the OpenSauced app</a> which creates a graph for contributors in a list, and all of a sudden, the page I was working on in our app started to freeze. I didn't understand what was going on initially, as I had been testing prior without any issues.</p>
<p>Then the lightbulb went on. I was using a different group of contributors for this page, and one of the contributors was <a href="https://github.com/dependabot?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-dependabot-and-art" target="_blank">Dependabot</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, you can't load millions of repositories associated with a contributor in a web page. üòÖ</p>

<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>I dropped a new blog post this week.

I was pretty happy with the solution I came up with for my component props with TypeScript. Please let me know what you think or how you would have approached it.</p>
<p>Shruti Kapoor (@shrutikapoor08), who I got a chance to meet at Remix Conf this year, had me on their fireside chat this past week. Loved the convos. Thanks for having me!</p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to have some fun with AI, Streamlit, LangChain, and tie it all into American Thanksgiving. AI Turkey anyone? </p>
