<p>I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs already December?!</p>
<p>It was a busy week in a good way for me, but I'm glad it's the weekend. üòÖ I wrapped up swimming lessons this week with another successful 12 consecutive laps. Feels pretty good as swimming is not my forte. Alright, enough pool talk. Let‚Äôs get to it!</p>
<p>Another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've been digging into SQL more lately for work, and I came across a great tool, <a href="https://tableplus.com/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">TablePlus</a>, that my co-worker <a href="https://johncodes.com/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">John</a> suggested. I've loved it so far. He mentioned he had heard about TablePlus from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aarondfrancis?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">Aaron Francis</a> on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V_CJBPZPes&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">PlanetScale YouTube channel</a>.</li>
<li>This week I was working on a file in VS Code, but I wanted to see another area of the same file at the same time. I didn't realize that <kbd>CMD</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> on non macOS) + <kbd>\</kbd> allowed you to open the same file again. It's too short for a blog post, but just a friendly reminder that there are so many little hidden gems in VS Code. I haven't written a post about VS Code recently, but here's my <a href="https://www.nickyt.co/pages/all-vscode-tips/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">VS Code Tips back catalogue</a>, for anyone interested.</li>
<li><code>const</code> seems to be the GOAT in TypeScript land. It‚Äôs one of the great ways to narrow a type. Here's another great use case <a href="https://x.com/mattpocockuk/status/1729975596854235447?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">care of Matt Pocock</a> for template strings. üî•</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>Shoutout to <a href="https://x.com/kvlly?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">Kelly Vaughn</a> for letting me know about how <a href="https://x.com/kvlly/status/1730312895051780098?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">Google trolls you when you search for this particular thing</a>. (Don't worry, it's safe for work)</p>
<p>I typically don't post about TV Shows in the newsletter, but I've really been enjoying Monarch.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs definitely worth a watch if you like sci-fi.</p>
<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>This week, on <a href="https://nickyt.live?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">my Twitch stream</a>, I hung out with <a href="https://www.hadithtech.com/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">Abdurrahman Rajab</a>. We discussed end-to-end (E2E) testing and then dug into the <a href="https://github.com/open-sauced/ai?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-const-is-the-goat" target="_blank">OpenSauced browser extension</a> to look at E2E testing for a browser extension. Thanks for hanging!</p>

<p>In terms of blogging, I finished off strong for the Virtual Coffee NaNoWriMo writing challenge.</p>
