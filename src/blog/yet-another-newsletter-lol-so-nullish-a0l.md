<p>Another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>This was a great talk from this year‚Äôs Vite Conf. Vite is clearly becoming the tool of choice for most framework author‚Äôs. Recently, <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a> made the switch and <a href="https://redwoodjs.com">RedwoodJS</a> has as well. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdGfluNMWFo&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish" target="_blank">Matias Capeletto | Vite's Philosophy | ViteConf 2023</a></li>

<p>The new and improved <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish" target="_blank">OpenAI developer quick start</a> dropped this week. From <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/logankilpatrick_openai-platform-activity-7119749262426476544-1YS1?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish" target="_blank">Logan Kilpatrick on LinkedIn</a>:</p>

<p>The goal is to optimize for the minimal setup steps required to send an API request and move devs on to more complicated topics.</p>

<p>In the latest version of Next.js, the Vercel team has improved package imports.

<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>My co-worker @bekahhw and me had another Hacktoberfest check-in this week. Hacktoberfest is almost done, so there's still time.</p>{% twitch "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1954146803?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish" %}
<p>I had a great conversation with Amy Dutton (@selfteachme), RedwoodJS core team member, this week on <a href="https://nickyt.live?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish" target="_blank">nickyt.live</a>. We discussed the new things in RedwoodJS, dev &amp; design.</p>
<p>Here's a highlight from the stream. Full recording dropping on <a href="https://nickyt.tube?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish" target="_blank">nickyt.tube</a> next week!</p>{% twitch "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1954598719?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish" %}
<p>This past Thursday, I had the privilege of giving a talk at the Hack for LA meetup. I talked about my career and open source. I'm not sure when the recording is dropping, but here's my slide deck</a> for anyone interested.</p>

[![Slide deck for my Hack for LA talk, Getting the Most Out of Open Source](https://www.nickyt.co/images/posts/_uploads_articles_fsrdtism3hcd9y33gfpq.jpeg)](https://nickyt.co/hack-for-la-2023?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish)



<p>Lastly, I was happy with some work I did regarding automation for OpenSauced this week. We use the take-action GitHub action that my co-worker @bdougieYO created. It's great for external contributors because they can self assign issues. The downside is it caused some back and forth when things weren't ready to be worked on.</p>
<p>For example, if an issue had the <code>üëÄ needs triage</code> or <code>needs design</code> label, we'd have to respond that it's not ready to be worked on yet.</p>
<p>With the changes, I made, there are now blocking labels, which is great for us as maintainers. If you're a maintainer on a project, the <a href="https://github.com/bdougie/take-action?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-nullish" target="_blank">take-action</a> GitHub action is definitely something you should consider.</p>
