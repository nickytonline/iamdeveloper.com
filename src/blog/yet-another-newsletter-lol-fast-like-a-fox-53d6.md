<li>I got early access to <a href="https://typehero.dev/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">typehero</a> and I have to say I'm really impressed. Great work on this <a href="https://twitter.com/trashh_dev?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">Trash</a> and team! If you're looking to up your TypeScript game, this might be for you. Also, <a href="https://github.com/typehero/typehero?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">typehero is open source</a>, so this could be a double whammy in terms of learning.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVpFAXBats&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">video from Jack Herrington</a> digs into the Lego concept with RSCs and data fetching, building off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CN9RCzznZc&amp;utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">Sam Selikoff's Next.js Conf 2023 talk</a>. His videos are so good and this one does not disappoint.</li>
<li>Netlify has been on a roll with platform primitives. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/introducing-netlify-blobs-beta/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">Blob storage</a> and an <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/introducing-netlify-image-cdn-beta/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">image CDN</a> both dropped this week, currently in beta.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>This was something super fun and potentially super practical I came across this week. tldraw release a draw a mockup and convert it to a real webpage. ü§Ø Check out <a href="https://makereal.tldraw.com/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">makereal.tldraw.com</a></p>

<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>One of my recent blog posts, TypeScript and React: Enforcing Props for Accessibility made it in the <a href="https://dev.to/devteam/top-7-featured-dev-posts-of-the-week-59oj?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">top 7 posts of the week on dev.to</a>!</p>

<p>This week, I got to hang with Lizzie Seigle on <a href="https://nickyt.live?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-fast-like-a-fox" target="_blank">my Twitch stream</a>. We built out an app that acts like a magic eight-ball called Turkey Time since it's American Thanksgiving soon. We ran into some snags, but we were able to get it working by the end of the stream.</p>
<p>Thanks again for hanging, Lizzie!</p>
