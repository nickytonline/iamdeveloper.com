<p>Another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is pretty remarkable TBH. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/22-year-old-firefox-tooltip-bug-fixed-in-a-few-lines-offering-hope-to-us-all/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-22-year-old-bug" target="_blank">How a 23-year-old first-time Firefox coder fixed a 22-year-old bug</a></li>
<li>Vercel just dropped a great blog post about cookies, <a href="https://vercel.com/guides/understanding-cookies?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-22-year-old-bug" target="_blank">Understanding Cookies</a>.</li>
<li>This is exciting work from Netlify.

The new Netlify Functions API aligns it with the same API Netlify Edge Functions offers including the context object which provides stuff like geolocation data.</li>
<li>This week I came across this wonderful site that explains React Server Components. Check out <a href="https://servercomponents.dev/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-22-year-old-bug" target="_blank">servercomponents.dev</a> </li>
</ul>
