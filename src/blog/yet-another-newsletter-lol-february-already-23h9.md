Another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!

## Around the Web

- Jack Herrington has a great [deep dive into RSCs and Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0OMdWJfdhg) which is worth a watch.
  
- Brian Vaughn, former React core team member, drop a really great package this week, [react-resizable-panels](https://react-resizable-panels.vercel.app/). I might look into incorporating this into [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza/). 👀
  
- My old co-worker Zach Leatherman has a great write up on web components. Check out [The good, the bad, the web components](https://www.zachleat.com/web/good-bad-web-components/).
  
- This was a great Podrocket episode with Dan Abramov on [React, RSCs, and the future](https://podrocket.logrocket.com/dan-abramov-react-rscs-future). Definitely worth a listen.
  

## Fun Stuff

This was technical and hilarious. Definitely worth a watch.

## Shameless Plugs

This week was a double header in terms of live streaming. Monday, I got to hang with Atila from CrabNebula where we dug into Tauri and SolidJS & Solid Start.

Wednesday, I was on my monthly 2 Full 2 Stack show on the [CFE.DEV](http://CFE.DEV) YouTube channel where we dug into the Astro Framework.
