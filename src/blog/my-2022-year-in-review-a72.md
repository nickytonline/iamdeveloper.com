Well, it's been a year! And you know what that means. Time for my year in review.

## New beginnings

After almost two and a half years at Forem, the software that powers dev.to, I decided to move on to new challenges.

My first day at Netlify was April 4th, and it's been fun and challenging ever since!

## Streaming

I did my last stream for dev.to, and then around the end of April, I started putting some love into my own Twitch stream. Although I loved doing the dev.to Twitch stream with my co-worker Christina; I had neglected my own channel for about two years. üò¨

I re-kickstarted my own stream and was happy with how it turned out. From a numbers perspective, even though I don't care as much about this as my lizard brain does, I went from about 100 followers to what I currently have, 425 followers. Thanks to everyone who thought my airtime was worth the watch, and a big thanks to my subscribers. 

And lastly, a big thank you to all the guests! üëáüèª

## Podcasting

I dipped my toes into the world of podcasting. I started repurposing content from my streams in audio format.

The podcast is still pretty new, but I've had a lot of fun pulling out what I think are great conversations from my Twitch stream and putting them in podcast format. Here's the latest episode with @chantastic. Loved this conversation with Chan!

## The Collab Lab

I've been helping at [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/) since December 2021, but it was mainly in Slack, supporting people. This summer, though, I got to mentor my first cohort. It was a lot of fun, and I'm super proud of what my team accomplished.

## Offsite

It's not why I joined Netlify, but I won't lie; having an offsite in Hawaii was pretty sweet!

![Me diving down snorkling in Honolua Bay, Hawaii](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/images/posts/_uploads_articles_tsz15cvt28nnb1n2cs1n.png)

I got to meet all my co-workers and enjoy some downtime. I was floating in the Pacific with my entire team at one point. I highly recommend meetings in the ocean.

## Talks

I gave a few talks this year and was even on a panel!

Tools for web developers: Live coding and debugging

## Layoffs

Unfortunately, like many tech companies, even Netlify was not immune to layoffs. 16% of the company was laid off. I made the cut, but it's a weird feeling making the cut. I'm still happy to be working at Netlify, and life goes on, but it's been weird getting back to whatever "normal" is. Having said that, I'm still super excited about the stuff we're working on.

And that's a wrap! I'm looking forward to enjoying the rest of my vacation and coming back recharged for 2023!
