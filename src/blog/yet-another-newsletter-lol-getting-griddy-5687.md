<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>Santosh Yadav (@santoshyadavdev) joined me on my live stream this week to discuss and live code all things Angular. One thing that stood out for me with Angular was the upgrade tooling and the new stuff that's dropped in Angular 17.</p>

<p>Thanks again for hanging, Santosh!</p>

<p>My latest blog post, TypeScript: Infer Types to Avoid Explicit Types, dropped this week. If you're new to TypeScript, or even if you aren't, you may find it helpful.</p>

<p>Although it was a shorter week for me, I continued to work on OpenSauced in public on Twitch.
