I've done this a few times on a live stream and there is always someone unaware of this so I wanted to share.

Assuming you have Node.js installed on your machine, you can run `npx gitignore your_language`, e.g. `npx gitignore node`, and it will generate a gitignore file for you for the given language.

Here's a clip from my stream today showing it in action. Maybe you'll find it useful in your next project!
