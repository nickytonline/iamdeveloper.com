<p>I can't believe we're almost in 2024! I think 2023 is finally catching up with me. Thursday, I was completely out of gas and felt a little run-down, so I took it easy the rest of the day. Looking to finish off 2023 strong. 💪</p>
<p>With that, another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Around the Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>Supabase dropped a great feature at their latest launch week. You can now <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-branching?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">branch databases</a>. I know that I'll be leveraging this feature for some end-to-end testing work I'll be putting in place at OpenSauced.</li>
<li>Corbin Crutchley dropped a great read, <a href="https://unicorn-utterances.com/posts/what-is-reactivity?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">What is Reactivity?</a></li>
<li>If you've ever encountered React hydration errors, this might be the tool you're looking for, builder.io's <a href="https://www.builder.io/blog/announcing-react-hydration-overlay?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">React Hydration Overlay</a>. I know that I'll be taking this for a test drive.</li>
<li>I love Andy Bell's work and content, and here's a great read on a new unit in CSS land, <code>lh</code>. Check out <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/lh-units-are-cool/?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">LH units are cool</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.threads.net/@addyist/post/C02JvzVNmmW?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">Addy Osmani over on Threads</a> had a great share, <a href="https://tastejs.com/movies?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">A non-trivial Movies app built in multiple frameworks</a>. It's a movie app built in various frameworks and it's all open source. 👏</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>This cracked me up. Thanks for <a href="https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1735456385528467637?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">sharing on X Seb Lorber</a>! 🤣</p>

<h2>Shameless Plugs</h2>
<p>This week on nickyt.live, I got to hang with Ray Deck (@rhdeck), founder of <a href="https://statechange.ai?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">statechange.ai</a>. We discussed low code tooling, AI, all the things.</p>

<p>I dropped probably what will be my last blog post of the year. If you're looking to move to Vitest from Jest for your React project, look no further:</p>

<p>The latest Jamstack Radio podcast episode dropped this week, and I was the guest. We discussed all things Next.js, frameworks, and the ever-evolving landscape of the JavaScript ecosystem.</p><p>Thanks for having me on @bdougieyo!</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/herodevs_thanks-for-the-github-sponsorship-herodevs-activity-7141550797074419712-ytWq?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">thank HeroDevs</a> for becoming my first GitHub sponsor. I recently <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/nickytonline?utm_source=nickytonline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-supabranch" target="_blank">set up my GitHub sponsor page</a>, so it's cool to see it seeing some action already. 💜</p>

<p>That's a wrap! Until the next one.</p>
