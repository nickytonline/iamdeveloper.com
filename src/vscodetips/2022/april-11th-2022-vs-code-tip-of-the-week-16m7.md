This week's tip of the week is care of Benjamin Pasero from the Twitters.

Local history has landed in VS Code! It’s currently only available in VS Code Insiders. On another note, I highly recommend the [Insiders edition](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). I’ve been using it for years and it’s super stable.
