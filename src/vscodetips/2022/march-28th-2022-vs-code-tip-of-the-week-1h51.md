This week's tip of the week is all about collapsing code blocks. You can click on the fold caret icon beside a code block to expand collapse it, but did you know if you hold the <kbd>ALT</kbd> (<kbd>‚å•</kbd> on Mac) while clicking the fold caret icon, it will collapse all code blocks except the one you just clicked on?
