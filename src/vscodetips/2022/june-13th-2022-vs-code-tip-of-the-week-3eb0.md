This week's tip of the week is coming from my old coworker @citizen428. On one my streams on [livecoding.ca](https://livecoding.ca), I show you how you can add a gitignore file to a project via `npx gitignore`.

Little did I know this is baked into VS Code!

Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on macOS) to open the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/command-palette).

Type in `Add gitignore` in the command palette.

You'll be presented with a language to generate the gitignore file for.

And there you go! You have a fresh gitgnore file in your repository now!

Happy VS Coding!
