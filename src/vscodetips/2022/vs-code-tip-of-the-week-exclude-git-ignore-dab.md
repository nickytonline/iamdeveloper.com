This week's tip is the Exclude Git Ignore user setting. This is a great feature to declutter the tree explorer of VS Code with files your project ignores via its `.gitignore` file.

The setting can be enabled/disabled in your user settings for VS Code. You can open the settings starting the command palette and searching for settings.

The user settings window opens. Search for `gitignore` and press the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key or use the filter button. Ensure the Explorer: Exclude Git Ignore option is checked.

You can also change the settings in `settings.json`. Open the command palette again and search for settings. This time select Settings (JSON).

In the settings.json file, add the following key/value pair:

`"explorer.excludeGitIgnore": true`

And that's it!
