This week's VS Code Tip came out in January of this year, but it seemed to go under the radar for me.

[Automatic replies for the terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_64#_automatic-replies) allow you to do automatically answer terminal prompts, like `Terminate batch job (Y/N)?`? As a developer, that's something you will typically say yes to, so you can configure the VS Code integrated terminal to handle this!

You can add a section to your user settings called `terminal.integrated.autoReplies`.

I mostly use the integrated terminal, and one prompt I get occasionally that I never want to answer yes to is when it asks me to source the .env file of a project, so I've gone ahead and added the following to my configuration.

```bash
{% raw %}
"terminal.integrated.autoReplies": {
  "dotenv: found '.env' file. Source it? ([Y]es/[n]o/[a]lways/n[e]ver)": "e\r"
}
{% endraw %}
```

I just tried it as I'm writing this post and it works like a charm.

Happy VS Coding!
