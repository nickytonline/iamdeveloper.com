This week's tip of the week is care of my old co-worker @citizen428. He mentioned that you can set a different font for a specific programming language. So, for example, in [Go](https://go.dev/), there are [fonts](https://go.dev/blog/go-fonts) that work really well with this language.

This is really cool, and as I was looking into this, I realized you can set all kinds of settings for a particular language. Looking into my own settings, I had already done this for certain things.

Check out the [Language-specific editor settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_languagespecific-editor-settings).

Thanks for the tip, Michael and Happy VS Coding!
