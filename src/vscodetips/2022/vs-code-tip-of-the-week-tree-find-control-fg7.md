This week's VS Code tip is the [Tree find control](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_70#_tree-find-control). Search for files within the tree explorer and have them filter right in the tree view!

Bring focus to your tree explorer in VS Code via keyboard or mouse. From there, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (<kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> on macOS) to make the find control appear.

In the find control, enter what you're looking for. In my case, I'm looking for files with `svelte` in them.

Press the filter button or use the keyboard to filter, and voil√†!

And that's it! Happy VS Coding!
