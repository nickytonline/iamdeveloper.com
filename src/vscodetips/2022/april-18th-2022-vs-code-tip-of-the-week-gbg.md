This week's tip of the week is care of Matt Bierner from the Twitters. Using [VS Code Insiders edition](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)? You can now drag and drop images and links into markdown files. I previously used the [Markdown Paste extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=telesoho.vscode-markdown-paste-image) to accomplish this, so it's nice to see it's native to VS Code now.

Thanks for the tip, Matt!
