This week's VS Code Tip off the Week is the [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) extension.

> Thunder Client is a lightweight Rest API Client Extension for Visual Studio Code

There's amazing tools out there like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Postwoman](https://dev.to/liyasthomas/postwoman-is-changing-name-igp) (now [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/)), etc. but I like the fact that I can use this directly within VS Code.

Select **Thunder Client New Request** from the available items in the list.

![The Thunder Client New Request window open in VS Code](http://localhost:8080/images/posts/_uploads_articles_ampt9xmx8rrm6036eg1a.png)

The New Request window opens with a test [GET request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) to https://www.thunderclient.com/welcome.

Click the *SEND* button to make the GET request. A response from thunderclient.com is returned.

![The response from the GET request to https://www.thunderclient.com/welcome. The value is the following JSON: {
  "message": "Welcome to Thunder Client",
  "about": "Thunder Client is a hand-crafted lightweight Rest API Client extension for VS Code.",
  "createdBy": "Ranga Vadhineni",
  "github": "github.com/rangav/thunder-client-support",
  "twitter": "twitter.com/thunder_client",
  "auth": "Supported Authentication methods Basic Auth, Bearer Token & OAuth 2.0",
  "graphql": "The client supports Graphql Query & Variables",
  "support": "For Bugs & Feature requests please submit on github",
  "share": "Please spread the word about Thunder Client"

There's a lot more you can do with the extension, so I encourage you to check out their repository on GitHub!
