I had a busy week last week including a conference so I completely dropped the ball on last week’s tip.

Anyways, this week’s tip of the week is courtesy of Josh Goldberg. When you’re running the debugger and hover over code in the file you’re debugging you will see the value. But what if you want to see language intellisense that you normally see when not debugging? You can press the <kbd>ALT</kbd> (<kbd>Option</kbd> on macOS) while hovering and boom, you have your language intellisense information again.

Thanks for the tip Josh!
