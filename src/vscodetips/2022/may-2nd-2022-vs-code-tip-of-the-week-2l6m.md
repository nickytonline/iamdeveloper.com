This week's VS Code Tip of the Week is a newly released extension, [TypeScript Error Translator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattpocock.ts-error-translator), that came out today!

This is super fresh/brand new, but it looks like it could be a super helpful extension for TypeScript devs. When you get a TypeScript error that you really don't understand, this might be the extension for you.

Thanks to Matt Pocock for creating the extension! If you're a fan of TypeScript and aren't already following him on Twitter, I suggest you do! ðŸ˜Ž
