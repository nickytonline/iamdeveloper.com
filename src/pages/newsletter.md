Yes it’s yet another newsletter folks! I post stuff in Slack for work and other communities I’m a part of, so instead of losing all those links to the “Slack”hole, they’ll be comprised in this newsletter too!

So welcome to links to cool and interesting stuff I found on the Internet during the week.
