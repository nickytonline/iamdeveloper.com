My name is Nick Taylor. I am a Lead Software Engineer with a focus on the front-end at Forem, the software that powers [DEV](https://dev.to).

I am a <em>big</em> fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, (P)React and Node. Once upon a time, I was into C#/ASP.NET. Aside from programming, I enjoy contributing to open source, hitting the gym, snowboarding, and a long long time ago, rugby.

I am also not a big fan of spiders. ðŸ˜¬

I'm super happy at Forem. It's my first dream job. I am paid to work in open source, work with awesome people, work with the developer community, live stream, and to top it off, it's remote. It checks off so many boxes for me.

Having said that, if you're ever able to potentially top all that, feel free to contact me. If you're curious what it's like to work with me, check out any of the [streaming I do](/pages/live-coding/). If you're curious what my work looks like, check out my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/nickytonline).
