## Who Is This Guy?

<img class="headshot" src="/images/colour-headshot-500x500.jpg" alt="Headshot of Nick Taylor" />

Hello! My name is Nick Taylor. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza). I'm a fan of Open Source and have a growing interest in serverless and edge computing. I'm not a big fan of spiders, but I know they're doing good work eating bugs. I also [stream on Twitch](https://nickyt.live).

I am a <em>big</em> fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, Node, and all things frontend. Aside from programming, I enjoy contributing to open source, hitting the gym, snowboarding, and rugby a long time ago.
